//Organization: OOP organizes code around objects and classes, whereas POP organizes code around
// functions.

//Encapsulation: OOP bundles data and methods together and restricts access, 
//while POP separates data and functions.

//Abstraction: OOP provides a higher level of abstraction through classes and interfaces 
//POP uses functions for abstraction.

//Inheritance: OOP supports inheritance, allowing code reuse and hierarchy; POP does not.

//Polymorphism: OOP naturally supports polymorphism; POP does not inherently support it.

//Modularity: Both paradigms encourage modularity, but OOP focuses more on reusable objects,
// while POP focuses on functions.

//In summary, OOP provides a more structured and reusable approach to programming by
// modeling software around real-world entities, while POP offers a straightforward,
// function-driven approach for solving specific problems.
